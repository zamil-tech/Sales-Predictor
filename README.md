# Sales-Predictor
Introduction:
In this report, we present a Deep learning project focused on using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for forecasting weekly sales based on historical data. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in sales forecasting and decision-making
Problem Statement
 The objective of this project is to forecast weekly sales based on various features such as temperature, fuel price, markdowns, consumer price index (CPI), unemployment rate, and store attributes. The sales data is provided as a time series, and the task is to predict future sales values.
 Data Exploration and Preprocessing
  Data Sources
•	train.csv: Contains historical sales data including store, department, date, weekly sales, and whether it's a holiday.
•	features.csv: Provides additional features such as temperature, fuel price, markdowns, CPI, and unemployment rate
•	stores.csv: Includes information about store attributes

# LSTM Model Implementation
###Data Reshaping for LSTM
•	Reshaped the data into sequences suitable for LSTM input with a specified number of time steps (time_steps).
 
# LSTM Architecture
•	Implemented an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.
•	Defined an LSTM layer with 50 units followed by a dense output layer for regression.
 

 # Model Training
•	Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
•	Trained the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size

# Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
##Model Evaluation
•	Evaluated the LSTM model on the test data.
•	Calculated Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the forecasting performance.


# Results and Analysis
•	Interpreted the model performance based on RMSE.
•	Reviewed feature importance using model-specific techniques (e.g., feature importances from 
LSTM).

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the LSTM model demonstrates promising performance in forecasting weekly sales based on historical data and relevant features. Further model refinement and parameter tuning may lead to improved accuracy and generalization
